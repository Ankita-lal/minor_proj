Cotton is a soft, fluffy fiber that grows in a protective case, known as a boll, around the seeds of the cotton plant. It is one of the most widely used natural fibers in the world, valued for its versatility, comfort, and durability. Cotton has been cultivated for thousands of years and is used in a variety of products, including clothing, bedding, and textiles.

                Cotton is known for its breathability, making it comfortable to wear in warm climates. It is also absorbent, capable of holding up to 27 times its own weight in water. Cotton fibers are strong and durable, yet soft and gentle on the skin. Additionally, cotton is easy to dye and can be blended with other fibers to enhance its properties.
